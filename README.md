MARC 21 records. It supports standalone records as well as record collection files.
Following carrier formats are supported:

- [ISO 2709](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2709)
- [MARCXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/),
- [MARC-in-JSON](https://web.archive.org/web/20151112001548/http://dilettantes.code4lib.org/blog/2010/09/a-proposal-to-serialize-marc-in-json/)

Additional formats can be added as necessary.
